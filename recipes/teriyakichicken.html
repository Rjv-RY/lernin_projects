    <br>
    <h2>What ingredients do you need, you ask? That's simple.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken breasts: use boneless skinless. Chicken thighs will work great too, just cook a little longer.</li>
        <li>Olive oil: Vegetable oil can be used here as well.</li>
        <li>Low-sodium soy sauce: You can also use 2 1/2 Tbsp standard soy sauce with 1 1/2 Tbsp water.
        <li>Honey: If you donâ€™t have this you can use more brown sugar.
        <li>Brown sugar: I use light brown sugar, dark would be fine or even granulated sugar.</li>
        <li>Rice vinegar: Apple cider vinegar will work well too. Even lemon juice can be used in a pinch.</li>
        <li>Optional:Use a hefty amount of orange juice, skip vinegar. Try it!</li>
        <li>Sesame oil: This has a bold flavor, so a little goes a long way. Unrefined peanut oil can be used as well, add extra.</li>
        <li>Ginger: Fresh is best, but if you must 1/2 tsp dried ginger could be used.</li>
        <li>Garlic: Again fresh is better, but 1 tsp dried granulated will work.</li>
        <li>Cornstarch: This helps thicken the sauce so it is critical to the recipe. Arrowroot starch could be substituted.</li>
        <li>Sesame seeds and green onions: Optional garnishes. Add them if preferred.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>Now, for the cooking process.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Heat oil in a large non-stick skillet or wok.
        <li>Add chicken and let cook (giving space between pieces) until slightly browned on bottom then flip chicken pieces over and cook through.</li>
        <li>While the chicken is cooking whisk together the teriyaki sauce mixture.</li>
        <li>Pour sauce into the skillet once the chicken is just nearly finished cooking through and let the sauce cook and simmer until thickened.</li>
        <li>Easy as that! Serve it warm over brown or white rice with steamed veggies.</li>
    </ul>
    <br><br><br>
    <p>Et voila! Teriyaki Chicken for the masses!(Or just you ;])</p>
