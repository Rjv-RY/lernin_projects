                    AYO LIFE IS TOO ZEN TO GIVE A SHIT HAHA</h1>
                <p>The Tao that is seen is not the true tao.
                    All things live in a state of constant harmony that 
                    is to not be infringed upon, and anything that 
                    infringes upon nature's harmony is its enemy.
                    It is the river's nature to flood and also to nourish.
                    Today's disaster may bring tomorrow's opportunities.
                    The Grass is to the Deer what the Deer is to the Tiger.
                    All that is stark and obvious in nature 
                    is the insignificance of man and his problems. 
                    His rage against the tides as they crash against 
                    the towering rocks on the shore, hoping to with his effort stop them,
                    is admirable yet foolhardy. A single wave can devour him yet 
                    there are millions in the sea, perhaps more numerous than even the stars.
                    Yet is not it man's nature to fight against destiny?
